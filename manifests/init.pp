# This configures the PkgNG Package manager on FreeBSD systems, and adds
# support for managing packages with Puppet.  This will eventually be in
# mainline FreeBSD, but for now, we are leaving the installation up to the
# adminstrator, since there is no going back.
#
# If you have purge_repos_d as true - then you'll have no repositories
# defined unless you define one. You want to do this as you'll want this
# module to control repos anyway.
#
# To install PkgNG, one can simply run the following:
# make -C /usr/ports/ports-mgmg/pkg install clean
#
# @example
#   include pkgng
#
# @param pkg_dbdir Full path to database directory for pkg(8)
# @param pkg_cachedir Full path to cache directory for pkg(8)
# @param portsdir Full path to ports directory
# @param options Array of options to write to pkg.conf(5)
# @param purge_repos_d Boolean when true removes unmanaged repos
# @param repos Hash of resources to pass to create_resources()
#
